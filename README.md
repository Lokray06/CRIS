# Data Encryption and Decryption into image

## Overview

This Python program provides a simple and effective method for encrypting and decrypting files using images. The process involves embedding the contents of a file into an image, creating a visually identical but modified image. The reverse operation extracts the original file from the modified image, restoring it to its initial state.
